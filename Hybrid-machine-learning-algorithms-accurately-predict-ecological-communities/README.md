Here are the savepoints of the hybrid model proposed in the manuscript *"Hybrid machine learning algorithms accurately predict marine ecological communities"*.

The savepoints can be uploaded in the application **iMESc - An Interactive Machine Learning App for Environmental Science**

The **iMESc** can be downloaded at [https://zenodo.org/record/7278042].

- Savepoint_DiversityIndex.rds:	Savepoint with diversity index datalist from the nematodes data.

- Savepoint_HybridModel.rds: Savepoint of the Preprocessing, Unsupervised, and Supervised Training and Test phases.

- Savepoint_Upscaling.rds: Savepoint of the Upscaling phase.

- Code script to select the closest coordinates points from the gridded data to the points of the test data and to calculate the evaluation metrics between the predictions of the Test data and the gridded data.
